# Making a README

## What is a README

A README is a document designed to inform someone about your program. This can include installation, documentation, the most recent changes, etc. Modern READMEs are written in Markdown, which allows them to be formatted using simple [syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links).

## Why Create a README

READMEs have become the standardized way of providing critical information about software to users. They allow you to document your work, give instructions and references, encourage interest, and facilitate understanding of your program.

## The Basic Structure of a README

The following is an example README structure: [Example](https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/109311bb0361f32d87a2)

However, it is important to keep in mind that every element in your README should provide pertinent and useful information. Some sections may not be relevant, so be sure to tailor your README to best serve the user. Your README should almost always include a title, a description, setup instructions, and contact information for issues.

## Moving Forward

Get into the habit of writing a README for every program you write. The more practice and feedback you get now the less of a headache writing READMEs will be in the future.
